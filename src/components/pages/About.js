            <p>
                I am a frontend Web developer with a background in Economics and Media.  I earned a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the University of Pennsylvania’s Coding Boot Camp.  I earned a bachelor’s degree in Applied Economics with a minor in Media & Communications from Ursinus College.  My strengths include working in a team setting, communication, and creativity.
                While at Ursinus College I was a member of the Lacrosse and Rugby teams.  I am a huge sports fan and love the Sixers, Eagles and Ohio State Football.  My other interests include fantasy football, gaming, hip-hop, Magic: The Gathering, and collecting sneakers.
