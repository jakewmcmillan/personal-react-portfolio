# Personal React Portfolio

This is my personal react portfolio.  It showcases some of the work that I have completed throughout this boot camp.  I used React Javascript to primarily build this page.  Additionall, I used Bootstrap with other generic CSS properties for the main page styling.  There are links to contact me along with my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.  You can also view a link to my resume here.  I would like to add some additional stylying and functionality once I have met the primary acceptance criteria.
